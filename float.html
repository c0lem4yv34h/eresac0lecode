P>
I want to go back to sleep, Im so tired and its like gross and gloomy today. The weather has been whack like usual but the tornado was weird. I was having dreams yesterday about these paintings I probably saw in a book. I think it was inspired by Hindu celestials, they had like blue skin and an eye on their palms and forehead.
