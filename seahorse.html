    <h1>Is Trippie Redd the next Adam Levine or will he go seahorse?</h1>
    <h2>Speaking on Trippie Redd</h2>
    <p>
        Trippie Redd is theming his entire tour with seahorses. He claims on "The Tonight Show" with Jimmy Fallon that Sea horses have become his muse. He dodged questions about his scandaleous cheating revenge on pregnant wife Coi Leray. She had confirmed his unfaithfulness on instagram with one singular emoji, a seahorse. </p>
    <h2>What could this symbolize?</h2>
    <p>Theories conduct that maybe he has been popping off about seahorses because he wishes Coi Leray could impregnate and cuff him. Seahorses impregnate their male mates and are one of the only species to do this. I think Trippie Redd, like most male seahorse species wanted to mother a child. But why did he cheat?</p>
    <h2>Revenge or vengence?</h2>
    <p>The history behind Trippie Redd and Coi Leray go a long way from them cosplaying together, making music and having a openly rootable relationship. This was until Coi Leray speculated Trippie had got with his ex Alexys. </p>
    <h2>Alexys looks like the hot fish from sharktales</h2>
    <p>Alexys had not broke contact with Trippie claiming they were "friends" which is very fishy of her. She had been beefing with Coi over Trippie for a minute. She akways snuck her eay in with the support if the fanbase. People liked Alexys with Trippie more which created insecurity in Coi's home.</p>
    <h2>Trippie drops</h2>
    <p>Trippie's new tour circled around a red seahorse may be one of his lowest selling sales. Most of his female fan base refuses to go to his concerts yet streams his music. He was seen to have been wearing a giant seahorse costume when coming out. He dropped his new single claiming to cheat on Coi with Alexys on their own counter sink admitting his wrong proving the allegations.</p>
    <h2>What will Coi do?</h2>
    <p>Will Coi be a single mother or conform with this hoarse and salty behavior coming from her husband.</p>
    <h2>Seahorses historic symbolism </h2>
    <p>Apparently Seahorses are lucky representing persistence and peace. Trippie in fact did have persistence for another woman. I couldn't imagine the betrayal she felt.</p>
    <p>What I personally think is that she should get her final lick back so they can co-parent and Trippie Redd can start making good angsty music again.</p>
    <h2>The tour set up</h2>
    <p>On may 28th, 2025 the set will be in the little ceaser auditorium. Trippie will have lots of gas and fire special effects. He always knew how to put on a show. The light beams put seahorses all over the stage.</p>
